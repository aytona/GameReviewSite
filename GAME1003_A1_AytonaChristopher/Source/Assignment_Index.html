			<p>Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is an intermediary of the Kingdom Hearts series. The game was released on November 11, 2004 on Game Boy Advance, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation 3; but the game I’m going to review is the Game Boy Advance version. The Kingdom Hearts series was developed by Square Enix and Jupiter for the handheld. It was then published by Disney Interactive Studios. With an ESRB rating of E for Everyone, it was one of the games I enjoyed playing the most when I was a child.</p>

			<p>Chain of Memories starts off where Kingdom Hearts left off, which was one of the things I did not understand at the start. I have not played the original Kingdom Hearts and felt lost as to what the story was about. The game does not introduce who the main character is and what his purpose is. The only thing backstory I got from the game is from the side characters Goofy and Donald but that wasn’t because the game introduced them but because I remember them from childhood movies and TV shows. Another thing that I did not enjoy is the recharge mechanic. You use cards to attack, but once you run out of cards you have to recharge (this action will make Sora stop moving) to get your cards back but not all your cards come back. This is problematic in boss fights where bosses have a ton of HP and you will eventually left with only a handful of cards before charging again. I spent more time recharging my deck than actually fighting. Lastly, it didn’t feel satisfying finishing the game. After going through all the trouble of scaling the castle to save the damsel in distress, Sora ends up just forgetting the whole adventure. It felt like there was really no point of the whole game but to pass time.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Although the game has its flaws, there were some things that made it enjoyable. What I found unique was the game mechanics of a card system. You fight with cards that are numbered which essentially indicates their power level from 0-9. Your opponent also uses cards and who ever plays the higher level card can interrupt the other, except cards with 0 which is the lowest level card but a cool mechanic is that it can counter all other cards as long as its used after. Another thing I liked is that the game has many different variety of cards ranging from basic attacks to spells and allies. You can combine these cards up to a 3 card combo and make a cool combo attack. Also, a feature I liked is that you have the freedom to visit which area you want first. Choosing to either go through Hercules’ world or Pinocchio's world, which ever you want you have the freedom to. Also, this extends to the rooms inside those worlds. To unlock the next room you have to use cards; these cards determine what is inside the room, either it be more mobs, faster mobs, or stronger mobs depends on the cards you use to unlock the room.</p>

			<p>In the end, I would rate this game an 8/10 because of the cool mechanics that made the whole game enjoyable from beginning to end but lost some points for the seemingly pointless story of the whole game.</p>
